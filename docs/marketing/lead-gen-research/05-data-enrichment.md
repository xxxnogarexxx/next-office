# Data Enrichment & Data-Driven Lead Generation — DACH

## Research Report — February 2026

---

## 1. INTENT DATA PROVIDERS

### Bombora
- Tracks research behavior across 18,000+ B2B content sources
- DACH coverage exists but weaker than North America
- **Pricing:** Starts ~$30,000/year. Too expensive at current revenue.
- **Verdict:** Skip. Revisit when revenue exceeds €1M.

### Cognism (includes Bombora intent)
- Bundles Bombora intent into Diamond plan ($25,000/yr + $2,500/user)
- More practical way to access intent data for DACH
- **Verdict:** If you go with Cognism for contacts, intent comes as bonus.

### 6sense
- Full ABM platform, 40+ languages including German
- **Pricing:** $50,000-$150,000+/year
- **Verdict:** Skip entirely. Far too expensive.
