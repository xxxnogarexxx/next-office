# Paid Advertising Channels for Coworking/Flex Office Brokerage in DACH

## Research Report — February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates five paid advertising channels for a coworking/flexible office brokerage operating in Germany and the DACH region. The business context is a broker (not operator) matching companies with coworking and flex office spaces, targeting revenue growth from ~EUR 400K to EUR 1M-1.5M. SEO has plateaued, making paid acquisition the logical next lever.

**Key finding:** Google Search Ads should be the primary channel, supplemented by LinkedIn for enterprise/mid-market leads and retargeting for conversion optimization. Meta/Instagram and programmatic display serve supporting roles. The German coworking market (valued at USD 492.5M in 2023, projected USD 1.47B by 2030) is growing at 16.8% CAGR, meaning demand tailwinds are strong.

**Recommended total monthly budget to start:** EUR 5,000-8,000/month across channels, scaling to EUR 15,000-25,000/month as campaigns optimize.

## 1. Google Ads (Search)

### Overview

Google Search is the highest-intent channel available. People searching "coworking Berlin," "flexible Bueroraum mieten Frankfurt," or "Buero mieten Muenchen" are actively looking for exactly what you sell. For coworking businesses, Google Ads can provide between one-third and two-thirds of total traffic, particularly for new market entries.

### Cost Benchmarks

| Metric | Range | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| CPC (Germany) | EUR 0.90 - EUR 7.00 | Germany average CPC is EUR 0.91 overall; competitive verticals (which office space is) see EUR 3-7. City-specific coworking terms will be in the EUR 2-5 range |
| Conversion Rate | 3-8% | Real estate averages 3.28% (WordStream 2025); well-optimized coworking landing pages can reach 5-8% |
| Cost Per Lead | EUR 40 - EUR 120 | Depends heavily on keyword selection, city competitiveness, and landing page quality. Spacefully reports ~$50 CPL as achievable for well-managed campaigns. Real estate average is $100.48 (WordStream 2025) |
| CTR | 5-9% | Real estate average CTR is 8.43% (strong for the category) |

### Keyword Strategy for DACH

**High-intent keywords (bottom-of-funnel):**
- "coworking [city]" / "coworking space [city]"
- "Buero mieten [city]" / "Bueroraum mieten [city]"
- "flexible office [city]" / "flexibles Buero [city]"
- "shared office [city]"
- "Bueroplatz mieten [city]"
- "Teambuero mieten [city]"
- "Office mieten [city]"

**Medium-intent (consideration):**
- "coworking Preise [city]"
- "Buero mieten guenstig [city]"
- "flexible Arbeitsplaetze [city]"
- "coworking vergleich [city]"

**Critical consideration for a BROKER:** You must differentiate from operators. Keywords like "coworking [city]" will pit you against WeWork, Regus, Design Offices, and local operators who are bidding on their own brand terms. Your advantage is that you aggregate supply -- your landing pages should emphasize "compare 50+ coworking spaces in [city]" or "all flexible offices in one search."

### Negative Keywords (Essential)

Essential negatives include: "jobs," "stellenangebote," "free," "gratis," "coworking software," "coworking management," "moebel," "desk kaufen," and any brand terms of operators you do not work with.

### Budget Recommendations

| Monthly Budget | Expected Leads/Month | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| EUR 1,500-2,500 | 15-35 leads | Single-city focus, limited keyword coverage |
| EUR 3,000-5,000 | 35-70 leads | 2-3 cities or deep coverage of one major city |
| EUR 5,000-10,000 | 70-150 leads | Multi-city DACH coverage |
| EUR 10,000+ | 150+ leads | Full DACH with aggressive bidding |

### Pros
- Highest purchase intent of any channel
- Measurable and directly attributable ROI
- Granular geographic targeting (city, district, radius)
- Fast to launch and iterate (results within days)
- Germany's average CPC is lower than UK or US markets

### Cons
- Direct competition with operators (WeWork, Regus, Design Offices, Spaces) who have large budgets
- CPC inflation -- costs have risen ~19% YoY for real estate keywords
- Requires ongoing keyword management, negative keyword pruning, and bid optimization
- Conversion rate in real estate is among the lowest (3.28% average)
- Click fraud can be an issue in competitive local markets

### Setup Complexity: Medium
Requires keyword research, negative keyword lists, city-specific ad groups, conversion tracking, and landing page optimization. 2-4 weeks to launch properly.

### DACH-Specific Notes
- German-language ads are essential
- Austrian and Swiss German have vocabulary differences
- Switzerland has higher CPCs due to higher purchasing power
- Multi-language campaigns needed for Switzerland (German, French, Italian)

### Recommendation: **PRIMARY CHANNEL -- Launch first, allocate 50-60% of initial paid budget**

---

## 2. LinkedIn Ads

### Overview

LinkedIn is the dominant B2B advertising platform in the DACH region, with over 20 million German users and superior engagement rates (12% active engagement vs XING's 5%).

### Cost Benchmarks

| Metric | Range | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| CPC | EUR 5-12 | Senior decision-maker targeting pushes toward the higher end |
| CPM | EUR 33-65 | For sponsored content targeting B2B audiences |
| CPL (Lead Gen Forms) | EUR 80-180 | Lead Gen Forms convert at 10-15% vs 2-5% for landing pages |
| CPL (Sponsored Content to LP) | EUR 120-250 | Lower conversion rates drive higher CPL |
| InMail Open Rate | 50-60% | Response rate 10-25% |
| InMail Cost | EUR 0.26-0.50/send | Per message delivered |

### Targeting Strategy

**Job Titles:** Office Manager, Facility Manager, Head of People/HR, COO, Geschaeftsfuehrer, Gruender/Founder, Head of Operations, Workplace Manager, Real Estate Manager

**Company Size:** 10-500 employees (sweet spot for flex office demand)

**Industries:** Tech/Startups, Consulting, Financial Services, Creative Agencies, Legal

**Geography:** Berlin, Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne, Duesseldorf, Stuttgart + Vienna, Zurich

### Ad Formats Ranked by Effectiveness

1. **Lead Gen Forms** -- Best CPL. Pre-filled forms reduce friction. 10-15% conversion rate
2. **Sponsored Content (Single Image)** -- Good for awareness + consideration
3. **Sponsored InMail/Message Ads** -- High open rates (50-60%). Best for ABM campaigns
4. **Video Ads** -- Lower CPL when done well but requires production investment
5. **Document Ads** -- Useful for thought leadership (e.g., "2026 Flex Office Market Report")

### Budget Recommendations

| Monthly Budget | Expected Leads/Month | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| EUR 2,000-3,000 | 12-25 leads | Minimum viable. Single campaign, tight targeting |
| EUR 3,000-5,000 | 25-45 leads | Multiple campaigns, A/B testing |
| EUR 5,000-10,000 | 45-80 leads | Full funnel (awareness + lead gen + retargeting) |

### Pros
- Unmatched B2B targeting precision
- Higher lead quality -- LinkedIn leads convert to SQL at 14-18% (vs Meta's 5-10%)
- Lead Gen Forms dramatically reduce friction
- 89% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn for lead generation

### Cons
- Most expensive per-lead of all social platforms (2-5x higher than Meta)
- Requires EUR 2,000+/month minimum
- Creative fatigue is faster on LinkedIn
- Lead quality from Lead Gen Forms can be inflated (auto-fill)

### Setup Complexity: Medium-High
3-4 weeks for proper setup.

### Recommendation: **SECONDARY CHANNEL -- Launch 4-6 weeks after Google Ads, allocate 25-30% of paid budget**

---

## 3. Meta/Instagram Ads (Facebook + Instagram)

### Cost Benchmarks

| Metric | Range | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| CPC | EUR 0.50-2.50 | Much cheaper than LinkedIn or Google Search |
| CPL (Lead Ads) | EUR 15-50 | High volume but low quality |
| CPL (Germany specifically) | EUR 45-135 | Germany CPL is roughly 2x global average |
| MQL-to-SQL Rate | 5-10% | vs LinkedIn's 14-18% |

### When Meta Works for a Coworking Brokerage

1. **Retargeting website visitors** -- This is where Meta excels for B2B
2. **Lookalike audiences** -- Upload customer list and target similar profiles
3. **Brand awareness in new markets**
4. **Content promotion**

### When Meta Does NOT Work
- Cold lead generation for B2B office space decisions
- Targeting by job title (far less precise than LinkedIn)
- Expecting sales-ready leads from Lead Ads

### Recommendation: **SUPPORTING CHANNEL -- Use primarily for retargeting (EUR 500-1,000/month). Allocate 10-15% of paid budget**

---

## 4. Programmatic Display & Retargeting

### Cost Benchmarks

| Metric | Range | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| CPC (Display) | EUR 0.50-1.50 | Much cheaper than search |
| CPL (Cold Display) | EUR 100-300 | Low conversion rates |
| CPL (Retargeting) | EUR 25-60 | 30-50% lower than cold traffic |
| CTR (Retargeting banners) | 0.7% | 10x higher than standard display |

### Recommendation: **SUPPORTING CHANNEL -- Start with retargeting only (EUR 500-1,000/month). Allocate 5-10% of paid budget**

---

## 5. Google Local / Maps Advertising

For a brokerage (vs an operator with a physical location), options are limited. Google Local Services Ads are NOT available for commercial real estate brokerage in Germany.

### Recommendation: **FOUNDATIONAL HYGIENE -- Set up GBP and location extensions (free/low effort). Do not allocate separate budget.**

---

## Cross-Channel CPL Benchmarks Summary

| Channel | Estimated CPL (DACH) | Lead Quality | Volume Potential |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|
