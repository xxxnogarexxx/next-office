# Inbound & Content Marketing Strategy Research: Coworking/Flex Office Brokerage in DACH

## Research Report — February 2026

---

## 1. LEAD MAGNETS — Lead Generation Potential: HIGH

**What works in this niche:**
- **City-specific Price Comparison Guides** (e.g., "Coworking-Preisvergleich Berlin 2026") — extremely high-intent
- **Annual Flex Office Market Report DACH** — position as data authority, PR asset and link magnet
- **"Flex Office Readiness Checklist"** — practical 1-2 page checklist for companies evaluating switch
- **"Hidden Costs of Coworking" Guide** — addresses real buyer anxiety
- **Office Space Calculator** — highest-converting format (see Interactive Tools)

**Conversion benchmarks:** Interactive tools convert at 5.2-8.3%, static PDFs at 3.8%, gated eBooks under 0.9%.

**Time to first results:** 4-8 weeks | **Cost:** EUR 500-2,000 per lead magnet

---

## 2. EMAIL MARKETING & NURTURE SEQUENCES — Potential: HIGH

**Recommended Drip Sequence:**

| Email | Timing | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Immediate | Welcome + resource + "What kind of space?" survey |
| 2 | Day 3 | "5 Mistakes When Choosing Flex Office Space" |
| 3 | Day 7 | Case study: "How [Company] Saved 40% on Office Costs" |
| 4 | Day 14 | City-specific market update |
| 5 | Day 21 | "Flex Office vs. Traditional Lease: Real Cost Comparison" |
| 6 | Day 30 | Soft CTA: "Book free 15-min consultation" |
| 7-12 | Monthly | Market updates, new spaces, trends |

**Segment by:** Company size, city/region, buying stage, space type needed.

**Key metric:** B2B email delivers ~30x ROI. Open rates for well-segmented German lists: 25-35%.

**Cost:** EUR 50-500/month for platform (Brevo, HubSpot, ActiveCampaign)

**DACH notes:** Double opt-in mandatory. Use EU-hosted platforms. German language. Formal tone ("Sie" not "Du") for B2B.

## 3. LINKEDIN ORGANIC CONTENT — Potential: HIGH

LinkedIn is now dominant B2B platform in DACH (20M+ German users, 12% active engagement vs XING's 5%).

**Dual-Track Strategy:**
- **Company Page:** 3-4x/week posts
- **Personal Brand (Founder):** 4-5x/week — 5-10x more organic reach than company pages

**Content mix:** 40% industry insights/data, 25% opinions/hot takes, 20% client stories, 15% behind-the-scenes

**Key formats:**
- Bilingual posts (German/English) achieve 41% broader reach in DACH
- Document posts (PDF carousels) with data visualizations
- Knowledge-rich content (LinkedIn deprioritizes engagement bait, rewards "knowledge transfer")

**Time to results:** 3-6 months | **Cost:** Free (5-10 hrs/week)

---

## 4. YOUTUBE / VIDEO CONTENT — Potential: MEDIUM

**Broker advantage:** Comparison content operators can't do:
- "Top 5 Coworking Spaces in Munich for Teams of 10+"
- "WeWork vs. Design Offices vs. Mindspace: Honest Comparison"
- "How Much Does a Flex Office Cost in Berlin? Real Prices 2026"

**Time to results:** 6-12 months | **Cost:** EUR 500-2,000/month

---

## 5. WEBINARS / VIRTUAL EVENTS — Potential: HIGH

73% of B2B marketers confirm webinars are a top source of high-quality leads.

**Recommended topics:**
1. "Flex Office Marktreport DACH 2026" — annual flagship
2. "Von der Festmiete zum Flex-Büro" — targets companies considering the switch
3. "Hybrid Work Strategie: 30% Bürokosten sparen"
4. City-specific events quarterly

**Cost:** EUR 100-500/month for platform (Zoom Webinar, Livestorm)

---

## 6. INTERACTIVE TOOLS — Potential: VERY HIGH

**This is the single highest-ROI channel to build.** Calculators convert at 40-50% when results are gated.

**Tools to build:**
1. **Price Calculator** — city, desks, space type, duration → estimated cost range
2. **Office Space Needs Calculator** — employees, hybrid %, meeting rooms → recommended sqm
3. **Flex vs. Traditional Lease Comparison** — current lease details → 5-year cost comparison
4. **Space Finder Quiz** — 5 questions → matched with ideal flex office

**Build approach:** Start no-code (Calculoid, involve.me: EUR 50-200/mo), then custom dev (EUR 5,000-15,000) once validated.

---

## 7. PODCAST — Potential: LOW-MEDIUM

Excellent for brand building but weak direct lead gen. Better as repurposed webinar content than standalone. Consider LinkedIn Audio Events instead.

---

## 8. REFERRAL PROGRAMS — Potential: HIGH

**Tier 1 — Client Referrals:** EUR 250-500 reward per successful placement
**Tier 2 — Partner Referrals:** 10-15% of first-year brokerage commission
**Tier 3 — Coworking Operators:** Revenue share for overflow referrals

**Time to results:** 1-3 months | **Cost:** Pay-per-result only

---

## HIGH-INTENT CONTENT TOPICS

| Priority | Topic Pattern | Intent |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | "Coworking Space [Stadt] Preise" | Very High |
| 2 | "Büro mieten [Stadt] kurzfristig" | Very High |
| 3 | "Coworking vs Büromiete Vergleich" | High |
| 4 | "Team Office [Stadt] 10 Personen" | Very High |
| 5 | "[Operator] Erfahrungen/Bewertung" | High |
