## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 both depend on Phase 1 and are independent of each other — they can be parallelized once Phase 1 is complete
- [Roadmap]: SEC-12 (Mapbox token restriction) placed in Phase 5 — it is a dashboard action, not a code change, and has no dependency on earlier phases
- [Roadmap]: REL-04, REL-05, REL-06 placed in Phase 3 (lead pipeline) alongside lead security — they all touch the same API route files
