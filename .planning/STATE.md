# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** Lead capture must be secure, reliable, and observable — every submission persists and notifies the team.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Infrastructure Foundations

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Infrastructure Foundations)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — Completed Phase 2 Plan 01: Env validation, health check, Google Ads placeholder guard (DEV-01, DEV-02, DEV-05, DEV-07)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] ~30%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: ~1.4min
- Total execution time: ~7min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-security-hardening | 2 | ~5min | ~2.5min |
| 02-infrastructure-foundations | 3 | ~3min | ~1min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2min), 01-02 (3min), 02-01 (1min), 02-02 (1min), 02-04 (1min)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 both depend on Phase 1 and are independent of each other — they can be parallelized once Phase 1 is complete
- [Roadmap]: SEC-12 (Mapbox token restriction) placed in Phase 5 — it is a dashboard action, not a code change, and has no dependency on earlier phases
- [Roadmap]: REL-04, REL-05, REL-06 placed in Phase 3 (lead pipeline) alongside lead security — they all touch the same API route files
- [01-01]: Error responses for security violations use generic "Ungultige Eingabe" — avoid leaking validation details
- [01-01]: parseCoord() duplicated per-file (3 Overpass routes) — no shared module, keeps files self-contained
- [01-01]: Hex-only colour validation for transit popups — simpler regex, covers all real OSM colour values
- [01-02]: All user-submitted fields HTML-escaped in broker emails — no exceptions, including href values (encodeURIComponent) and display text (escapeHtml)
- [01-02]: Rate limit 10 req/min/IP, in-memory Map, no persistence across restarts — sufficient for abuse protection
- [01-02]: escapeHtml duplicated per route file — consolidation deferred to Phase 3 REL-04
- [02-02]: CSP includes unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval for script-src — required by Next.js hydration and dev hot reload
- [02-02]: CORS allowlist is explicit (next-office.io + www subdomain + localhost in dev) — no wildcard * allowed
- [02-02]: OPTIONS preflight returns 204 with Access-Control-Max-Age 86400 to cache preflight 1 day
- [02-02]: Middleware matcher broadened to include /api/ routes — isApiRoute check routes CORS vs tracking cookie logic
- [02-04]: Single job CI (not parallel) — small codebase, runner overhead outweighs parallelization
- [02-04]: Placeholder env vars for NEXT_PUBLIC_* in CI — Next.js bakes them at build time, placeholders allow CI build to succeed without secrets
- [Phase 02-01]: env.ts uses zero external dependencies — plain TypeScript only, no zod/joi
- [Phase 02-01]: Health check always returns HTTP 200 (ok or degraded) — avoids false load balancer failures
- [Phase 02-01]: Google Ads placeholder validation is console.warn only — vars are optional, app runs without them
