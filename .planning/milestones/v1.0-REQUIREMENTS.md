# Requirements: next-office.io Launch Readiness

**Defined:** 2026-02-25
**Core Value:** Lead capture must be secure, reliable, and observable — every submission persists and notifies the team.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for launch readiness. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Security

- [x] **SEC-01**: Overpass API proxy is parameterized — no arbitrary user-controlled queries forwarded (S1)
- [x] **SEC-02**: lat/lng params validated as numbers before Overpass QL interpolation (S2)
- [x] **SEC-03**: Transit popup HTML-escapes all OpenStreetMap tag values before rendering (S3)
- [x] **SEC-04**: Notification email templates HTML-escape all user-provided fields (S4)
- [x] **SEC-05**: Lead endpoints enforce per-IP rate limiting (S5)
- [x] **SEC-06**: Security headers configured (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, Referrer-Policy) (S6)
- [x] **SEC-07**: Lead form endpoints have CSRF protection (S7)
- [x] **SEC-08**: Email validation uses RFC-compliant check on both main and LP routes (S8)
- [x] **SEC-09**: Cookie values (gclid/gbraid/wbraid) validated for format and length (S9)
- [x] **SEC-10**: Lead inserts use scoped Supabase access instead of service role key (S10)
- [x] **SEC-11**: Lead request bodies validated for input size and field types (S11)
- [ ] **SEC-12**: Mapbox token restricted to allowed URLs in dashboard (S12)

### Performance

- [x] **PERF-01**: Client JS payload reduced — listings data split so search/city pages receive only needed fields (P1)
- [x] **PERF-02**: Search and city pages render as server components with client islands for interactivity (P2)
- [x] **PERF-03**: City and listing pages use generateStaticParams for static generation (P3)
- [x] **PERF-04**: Mapbox GL lazy-loaded on listing detail pages (triggered by viewport) (P4)
- [x] **PERF-05**: ListingCard carousel renders only visible photos, remaining lazy-loaded (P5)
- [x] **PERF-06**: Transit API has appropriate timeout (30s), retry with backoff, and error handling (P6)
- [x] **PERF-07**: /api/transit responses include Cache-Control headers (P7)
- [x] **PERF-08**: LeadForm does not import full listings.json — cities extracted to separate module (P8)

### UX / Frontend

- [x] **UX-01**: Custom branded 404 page exists with navigation back to site (U1)
- [x] **UX-02**: Error boundaries exist for main layout and key pages (U1)
- [x] **UX-03**: Invalid city slugs return 404 instead of showing all listings (U2)

- [x] **UX-06**: Footer year rendering does not cause hydration mismatch (U5)
- [x] **UX-07**: Search bar dropdown has proper ARIA attributes (role="listbox", aria-activedescendant) (U6)

- [x] **UX-12**: Decorative icons have aria-hidden="true" across main site (U11)

### DevOps / Infrastructure

- [x] **DEV-01**: Runtime env var validation fails fast on startup with clear error messages (D1)
- [x] **DEV-02**: .env.example documents all required environment variables (D2)
- [ ] **DEV-03**: Sentry error monitoring captures client and server errors with source maps (D3)
- [x] **DEV-04**: CI/CD pipeline runs lint + build on push (D4)

### SEO / Analytics

- **UX-V2-04**: UTM parameter capture on main site

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| LP subfolder changes | Separate project with own git repo |
| New test suite | Fixes only — no greenfield test infrastructure |
| Contentful import script optimization | scripts/ not in launch path |
| Mobile app | Web-first platform |
| OAuth / user accounts | Public site, no auth needed |
| Real-time chat | Not core to brokerage model |
| Database migration (away from JSON) | Future milestone — JSON sufficient at current scale |
| Pre-commit hooks | P2 item, defer to post-launch |
